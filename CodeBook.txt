Data was obtained from the following website 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
and the data was downloaded from the following zip file 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The data represent 561 metabolic measurements taken with Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone from participants while they were participating in the following activities: standing, laying down, sitting, walking, walking upstairs, or walking downstairs.  
The raw data lacked column and row names.  The column names represent the metabolic measurement and the row names represent the activity (walking, sitting, etc). Therefore, the column names and the row names were bound to the data.
The raw data had also been split into test and training data, and for this assignment these two data sets were bound together.
We were only interested in the mean and standard deviation of each variable so we selected the 79 (of 561) measurements that contained those metrics.
